Exploratory Statistical Analysis in Maximizing Predictive Power of Modeling Automotive Insurance Claim Cost.
Full disclosure: This project was made with help from others, this was not all my work. Also made in conjunction with our industry partners as a part of my Capstone Experience course in the last semester of my statistics degree.
Also some slight edits have been made to some of the files to remove names and other potentially sensitive information. So the code will not work directly without minor changes, though I have added notes on what was there.
Dataset has also not been included as I don't believe it's something I can share.
I also didn't do any of the machine learning parts of this, though they didn't produce the best results in this case, so I don't really think they were that useful for this project.
